A game designed and built using HTML, CSS/SCSS, BEM and JavaScript.

About :
-------
Tic-tac-toe is one of my childhood games.
Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns filling the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
It can be played by 2 players or a human player versus computer. 

This game is designed for responsive model and is suitable to work on different device widths like mobile, tablet and desktop view.


Usage Instructions :
------------------
- Once the option is selected on first page for '2 PLAYERS', the game will be started.
- The first player's coin will be 'X' ( denoted by 'Red' color) and second player's coin will be 'O' ( denoted by 'Blue' color).  
- If the user had already played a cell, the same cell can't be played again and will be disabled.
- All the cells are **disabled** when there is any winner or a tie until the game is restarted.
